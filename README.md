# sudoku

The game was developed by Fahad Ahmed Khan as Project 1 for the course CS 111 -- Computational Thinking II at Habib University.

SUDOKU:
Sudoku is a logic-based, combinatorial number-placement puzzle. The name Sudoku or more correctly 数独 comes from Japan and consists of the Japanese characters Su (meaning 'number') and Doku (meaning 'single') but the was not invented in Japan. Sudoku originated in Switzerland and then traveled to Japan by way of America. Sudoku has its deep roots in ancient number puzzles

HOW TO PLAY:
The goal of Sudoku is to fill in a 9×9 grid with digits so that each column, row, and 3×3 section contain the numbers between 1 to 9. At the beginning of the game, the 9×9 grid will have some of the squares filled in. Your job is to use logic to fill in the missing digits and complete the grid. Don’t forget, a move is incorrect if:
	--Any row contains more than one of the same number from 1 to 9.
	--Any column contains more than one of the same number from 1 to 9.
	--Any 3×3 grid contains more than one of the same number from 1 to 9.

INSTRUCTIONS:
The game can be controlled using a keyboard and/or mouse. However, the buttons can only be accessed using a mouse.
When the user starts the program, a window opens with the menu shown. The user can then select the difficulty level of the puzzle ('Easy', 'Medium' or 'Hard') or he/she can close the program. Once the user selects a difficulty level, a puzzle is loaded from one of the .txt files and the game screen is shown. The puzzles used in the program were taken from http://www.sudoku-solutions.com/
